#We are calling super().greet() inside the constructor to make sure that the parent class constructor is called first and since it's using self parameter(greet method), calling it inside the constructor ensures that it has the correct context (the class of the object) and can access the method from the parent class correctly.
# Calling greet() outside the constructor may not work because thereâ€™s no guarantee the context (self) is available or it might not be properly invoked within an instance context.
